Polyglot is a language identifier for detecting text documents containing text
written in more than one language, and for identifying the languages therein.
It is an experimental project. For monolingual language detection, langid.py[1]
is a proven off-the-shelf solution.

The theoretical motivation behind it is described in a forthcoming TACL paper.
A preprint can be obtained by directly contacting the author.
